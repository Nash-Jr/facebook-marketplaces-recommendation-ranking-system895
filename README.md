# Facebook Marketplace AI Recommendation System

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the recommendation ranking system behind Facebook Marketplace, a platform for buying and selling products on Facebook. The goal of this system is to use AI and machine learning techniques to recommend the most relevant product listings to users based on their personalized search queries.

## Project Overview

Facebook Marketplace is a popular platform that allows users to buy and sell a wide variety of products, ranging from electronics and furniture to clothing and other household items. To provide users with a seamless and personalized shopping experience, the platform relies on an advanced recommendation system that leverages AI and machine learning.
This project aims to replicate the core functionality of the Facebook Marketplace recommendation system. It involves the following key component

Image Feature Extraction: The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model, such as ResNet-50, to extract visual features from product images. These features are used to represent the visual characteristics of each product listing.

Similarity Search: The extracted image features are stored in a highly optimized index using the FAISS library. When a user searches for a product, the system extracts the features of the query image and performs a nearest-neighbour search to find the most visually similar product listings.

Ranking and Personalisation: In addition to visual similarity, the system considers other factors, such as user preferences, browsing history, and marketplace activity, to rank the search results and provide personalized recommendations to each user.

API Integration: The project includes a FastAPI-based web application that exposes the recommendation system as a RESTful API. This allows the system to be easily integrated into the larger Facebook Marketplace infrastructure or used as a standalone product search and recommendation service.

## Key Features

Efficient Image Feature Extraction: The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model to extract visual features from product images, enabling fast and accurate representation of product characteristics.
Scalable Similarity Search: The FAISS library is used to build a highly optimised index for the extracted image features, allowing for efficient nearest-neighbour search and retrieval of similar product listings.
Personalized Recommendations: The system considers various user and marketplace signals to rank the search results and provide personalised recommendations that are tailored to the user's preferences and behaviour.
RESTful API: The recommendation system is exposed as a RESTful API using FastAPI, making it easy to integrate into larger applications or use as a standalone service.

## Technical Stack

Python: The primary programming language for the project.
PyTorch: Used for building and fine-tuning the deep learning model for image feature extraction.
FAISS: Utilized for efficient nearest-neighbour search and similarity computation.
FastAPI: Employed to build the RESTful API for the recommendation system.
Uvicorn: Used as the web server for running the FastAPI application.
