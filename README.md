# Facebook Marketplace AI Recommendation System

## Introduction

Facebook Marketplace is a platform for buying and selling products on Facebook. This project is an implementation of the system behind the marketplace, which uses AI to recommend the most relevant listings based on a personalized search query.

## Features

- **Search Personalization**: The system analyzes user preferences, browsing history, and purchasing patterns to personalize search results and provide relevant recommendations.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Users can enter search queries in natural language, and the system processes these queries to understand the user's intent and extract relevant keywords.
- **Machine Learning Models**: The system employs machine learning models to analyze product listings, user data, and search queries, enabling accurate recommendation generation.
- **Real-time Updates**: As new listings are added or user preferences change, the recommendation engine dynamically updates to provide the most current and relevant suggestions.
- **User Feedback**: Users can provide feedback on the recommendations, which is used to continuously improve the system's accuracy and relevance.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Framework**: pytorch, scikit-learn
- **Data Storage**: PSQL
